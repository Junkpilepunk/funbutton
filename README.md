# funbutton
Intended tu use With RaspberryPi and some hardware. 
You Push one of 6 Buttons and each Button plays a (maybe) funny sound.

# Hardware needed (or was used by me) to use with the RaspberryPi

I used 6 pushbuttons, some jumperwires and  bread-board to connect the components,
but you can solder the components together as well.

# Pin configuration

I will tell you my in configuration so you can use this program "out of the box".
You can Change the pin configuration to whatever your needs are.

Pin 1 - source for Signal (all pushbuttons parallel)

Button1: Pin 11 (GPIO 17)
Button2: Pin 13 (GPIO 27)
Button1: Pin 15 (GPIO 22)
Button1: Pin 16 (GPIO 23)
Button1: Pin 18 (GPIO 24)
Button1: Pin 22 (GPIO 25)

# Usage

To run the program properly, you have to put soundfiles named "1.wav" to "6.wav" in the programfolder.
Fell free to change anything for your needs.

There is no feature implemented to stop the running program. It was intendet to use as an autostart program.
If you want to stop it you have to use famous ctrl+c.

# Additional comment (reading optional)

I would be proud if you want to download that crap and try it out. I share this (not even semi-professional developed) program with the hope that there is some beginner that an use it and learn from it to do some useful stuff.

If you want to comment on this or crticise this i would apreciate that. But if you just want to tell me that it is useless crap.... well... trust me, i know that already.

# P.S.

Fist bump
